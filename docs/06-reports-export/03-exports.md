## About identifiers

REDCap allows for personally identifiable information to be automatically removed from reports and exported data. Any field can be marked as an identifier.

REDCap uses the US HIPAA model to list what are likely to be personally identifying data. You can look it up using the REDCap help. It is a starting point and it likely to be similar to the Australian model.

If you are collecting personal information from participants you should refer to the Privacy Principles found in the *Privacy Act 1988* (Cth) and Griffithâ€™s Privacy Plan (see [https://www.griffith.edu.au/about-griffith/corporate-governance/plans-publications/griffith-university-privacy-plan#research](https://www.griffith.edu.au/about-griffith/corporate-governance/plans-publications/griffith-university-privacy-plan#research)).
