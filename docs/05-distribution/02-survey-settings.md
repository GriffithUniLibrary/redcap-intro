# Survey settings

## Survey settings

You can set the overall look and feel, as well as the behaviour, of your survey before sending it out.
You need to enable the instrument as survey first before `Survey Settings` becomes available. We have enabled Survey in the main project settings earlier, but that doesn’t automatically make each instrument a survey.

## Enabling your survey

You’ll notice that there will be a green button under each survey reading `Enable`. 
Tip: If you don’t see it, you need to go to your Project Setup and select Use surveys in this project.

### Moving your project to production status

When we are happy with our project settings, instrument design and survey settings, we can proceed to bring our project into Production status. Moving to Production status allows us to collect real data.
NB: Once your project is in Production status, structural changes become much more difficult. This is because it’s possible that changes you make might result in data loss. You may need to submit any changes to an administrator.
Obtaining ethics approval

1. Click on `Project Setup` on the left-hand navigation.
2. Note that The `Main Project Settings` section shows a green check and the words _“I’m done!”_
3. We are now done with the second section (design data collection instruments). Click _I’m done_.
4. The `Optional modules` allow for longitudinal studies and randomisation. These are outside the scope of today’s workshop.
5. Click _I’m done_ on the `Optional modules`.
6. Click _I’m done_ on `Set up project bookmarks`.
7. Click _I’m done_ on `User rights and permissions`.
8. `User rights` may be important if you are collaborating with other researchers on this project. They are outside the scope of this workshop.
9. Click _I’m done_ on the `Test your project` section.
10. Click _I’m done_ on `Move your project to production status`.

It is not strictly necessary to click all of the “I’m done” boxes to move to production, but it is a handy checklist to make sure you have completed what you need to do before going live.
