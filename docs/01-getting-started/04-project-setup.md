## Basic details

### Project title

Give the project a title. It won't be visible to your participants so you can call it what you want. 

### Project's purpose

Selecting `Research` allows you to provide the names of the primary investigators. This information is not used by the university and has no effect on the functionality of your project. For now, just choose `Practice / Just for fun`.

### Project folders

You can use this to organise your projects if you are working with several. You can ignore it for now.

### Project notes

Optional. Ignore for now.

### Project creation options

You can use a pre-created template to start a new project quickly. Since we are focused on getting to know REDCap, we will start with a blank project.
