## Where to find REDCap

The Griffith REDCap instance is hosted at [www151.griffith.edu.au/redcap/](https://www151.griffith.edu.au/redcap/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 

Alternatively, you can navigate to the REDCap link from:
- [**eResearch Services website**](https://www.griffith.edu.au/eresearch-services/resources){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} > Researcher Software and Tools > click **REDCap**, or
- [**Library website**](https://www.griffith.edu.au/library/research-publishing/working-with-data/create-and-capture){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} > Create and capture > REDCap > click **REDCap at Griffith**

You'll see a welcome screen with a place to enter your username and password. Use your Griffith s-number and password to enter.

There is a password reset link alongside the Login button. There is also a link at the bottom of the screen to submit a support request.
