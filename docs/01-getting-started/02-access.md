## Where to find REDCap

The Griffith REDCap instance is hosted at [www151.griffith.edu.au/redcap/](https://www151.griffith.edu.au/redcap/). You'll see a welcome screen with a place to enter your username and password. Use your Griffith s-number and password to enter.

There is a password reset link alongside the Login button. There is also a link at the bottom of the screen to submit a support request.

This isn't the only place to get support, so don't panic. We'll show you the others later.
