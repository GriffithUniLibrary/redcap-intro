# Types of project

There are two basic project types in REDCap, 'classic' and 'longitudinal'.

## Classic projects

A classic project is a set of data collection instruments, designed for a single round of data collection (which can last for any amount of time). Data can be entered either by researchers or by participants. 

## Longitudinal projects

A longitudinal study captures data from the same cohort over time, usually at defined points. It may also track more than one cohort, for example, a control group and an intervention group.
