# Create a project

## The New Project screen

When you click `New Project` in the top menu, you'll be presented with the` New Project` screen. You can give your project any title that makes sense to you â€” your project name won't be visible to external participants. You can choose the `purpose` of your project here. Setting a purpose has no effect on the operation of the project. If you set it to 'Research', you have the option of adding some information about the type of study you are doing. We will just set the `purpose` to 'Practice / Just for fun'.

You can start with an empty project, or use a template provided by REDCap. Templates can be a useful way of getting started with a basic project structure, if you know the type of project you need. We are going to start with an empty project.
