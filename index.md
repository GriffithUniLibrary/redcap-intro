## Topic and aims

This resource provides an introduction to using the REDCap (REsearch Data Capture) tool at Griffith University. It may be used on its own or in conjunction with the Griffith RED workshop 'Introduction to REDcap@Griffith'.

The aim of this workshop is to get you up and running with REDCap quickly. We aim to cover the fundamentals so you can start to use the service. It is not intended to act as comprehensive documentation. We've left out advanced topics like scheduled invitations, randomisation and longitudinal study design.

## Plan your project on paper first!

A significant amount of careful planning and design needs to happen before you start building your survey. The stronger your preparation, the more credible your methodology will be.
{:. .warning }

Your **preparation** phase should have included:

- Research problem development
- Literature review
- Concept mapping and identification of measures
- Survey cohort identification

Your **design** phase should have included:

- Clarifying the _answers_ you want (not the questions)
- Question design
- Question validation
- Sampling design

This is a _bare-minimum_ template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site _locally_. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, just click "[use this template]"!
